          <h1>Automatically Installed JavaScript Must Die</h1>
          <p>In Richard Stallman's essay, "The JavaScript Trap", it is pointed out that people run proprietary software which is silently, automatically installed into their browsers every day. In fact, he very much downplayed the problem; not only are most users running proprietary programs every day merely by browsing the Web, they are running dozens or even hundreds of such programs each day. The JavaScript Trap is very real and prolific; the Web is said to be so broken without these non-standard, usually proprietary extensions to HTML that Web browsers have moved toward not even offering an obvious option to disable JavaScript; disabling JavaScript, it is argued, will only cause confusion.</p>

          <p>It's obvious that we need to solve this problem. However, in focusing on whether or not scripts are "trivial" or libre, Mr. Stallman misses a crucial point: this behavior of automatic, silent software installation is, itself, the main problem. That most of the software in question is proprietary is merely a side-effect.</p>

          <p>In response to Mr. Stallman's article, an extension for Firefox and Firefox-derived browsers called LibreJS was developed. This extension automatically analyzes all JavaScript on a page to determine whether or not they are either trivial or libre; if one of these conditions is determined to be true, the software is executed. Otherwise, it is blocked. I appreciate the LibreJS project and what it's trying to do. But I think that LibreJS is fundamentally the wrong approach to solving the problem.</p>

          <p>Right now, LibreJS is failing because it requires a format that isn't recognized anywhere, but theoretically, this could be solved in the future, so let's suppose that it does. Let's suppose even further that LibreJS succeeds so much that it causes a large portion of the Web to release scripts under libre licenses and document the licenses in a format LibreJS can understand.</p>

          <p>It seems great on the surface, but what follows from this is that software is still being silently installed into our browsers every day. The only difference is that LibreJS thinks the programs are libre.</p>

          <p>I don't want to downplay the importance of all software being libre. However, when any software is automatically installed onto our computers by the request of another party, it makes exercising freedom 0 properly impossible. The problem here is that it is assumed that you want all of these JavaScript programs, of which there are likely to be hundreds of new ones each day, to be executed on your computer, typically before you even have a chance to check the source code.</p>

          <p>It is not enough for software to be libre. It also needs to not be installed unless the user authorizes it, and then not updated unless the user authorizes it. Simply visiting a Web page doesn't count as authorization to install whatever software the page wants to install; after all, I have visited the Debian website recently, but that doesn't mean that I authorize an installation of Debian on my computer. Similarly, visiting a Web page that requests installation of JavaScript doesn't necessarily mean you want to install that JavaScript.</p>

          <p>We should not waste our efforts trying to reconcile automatic JavaScript program installation with liberty in our computing. Instead, we must reject, and ultimately seek to put an end to, all of it, whether the software in question is libre or proprietary.</p>

          <p>When I first proposed this, some people asked what I proposed as an "alternative" to JavaScript. One person even accused me of trying to "stop the web in its tracks". This is blatant nonsense. Eliminating automatic JavaScript program installation would not "stop the web in its tracks". If it would stop anything in its tracks, it would be proliferation of "Web applications", and it's obvious that normally installed software can replace these.</p>

          <p>Additionally, I don't propose to eliminate JavaScript. I'm not too fond of the language from a programming standpoint, but there's nothing ethically wrong with it. I propose to eliminate <em>automatic installation</em> of JavaScript programs. There is already a separate mechanism for the user to install JavaScript programs in their browser: user scripts (also known as "Greasemonkey scripts", after the extension which adds support for user scripts in some browsers). I have a few user scripts installed in my browser, myself.</p>

          <p>The reason I propose to reject automatically loaded JavaScript entirely, rather than trying to make said JavaScript libre and trying to modify browser behavior to require user intervention before installing requested JavaScript, is because the latter option requires far more effort and no additional benefit. We already have a system for user scripts.</p>

          <p>The current automatic JavaScript loading system cannot be reconciled with user freedom without turning its whole design on its head and eliminating its purpose. Let's not waste our effort trying to do this. Let's instead focus our efforts on convincing webmasters to stop requiring JavaScript, and developing user scripts to replace requested JavaScript on popular sites whose webmasters refuse to cooperate.</p>
