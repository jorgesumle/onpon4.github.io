          <p>This is a list of common arguments used to justify proprietary software, and responses to those arguments. A plain-text version can be found <a href="arguments.txt">here</a>, or alternatively <a href="http://pastebin.com/W85FXFfE">here</a>.</p>

          <p><blockquote>"It's not losing freedom because I can choose to run it or not."</blockquote></p>
          <p>Just because you can choose to be free does not mean you are more free if you choose not to be free. It simply means that if you are not free, you made the wrong choice.</p>

          <p><blockquote>"Why should I care? I can't/don't want to change the software anyway."</blockquote></p>
          <p>You may not want to change a particular program now, but you may want to change it in the future, or you may want to pay a programmer to change it for you in the future. As a human, you deserve that freedom, so it is unethical for it to be deliberately taken away from you.</p>
          <p>Think of it this way: if you own a car, you know that the car comes with certain freedoms: the freedom to change it, the freedom to fix it, and the freedom to pay someone else to do these things for you. Though not exactly the same, free software is similar: it gives you the freedom to change the program, the freedom to fix bugs in the program, and the freedom to pay someone else to do these things for you. Most people who own cars do not have the knowledge necessary to do make significant changes or effect significant repairs, but it would still be rather unwelcome for the car to deliberately prevent you from doing these things the way proprietary software does; it's not the car company's right to control what goes on in your car. Similarly, it it is not software companies' right to control what goes on in your computer.</p>
          <p>In addition, proprietary programs whose source code is secret often contains malicious features: spyware, which reports aspects of what you do to someone else without your consent; backdoors, which change your computer without your consent; and digital restriction mechanisms, which intentionally restrict your activities. Your only defense against such malicious features is to have the freedom to review the code which is being executed on your computer.</p>

          <p><blockquote>"Why can't you respect my freedom to choose to use proprietary software?"</blockquote></p>
          <p>I am not disrespecting your freedom by telling you that you shouldn't use proprietary software. I would be disrespecting your freedom if I was somehow forcing you to use free/libre software, which I'm not, and that's not even something I could do if I wanted to.</p>

          <p><blockquote>"It's the developer's freedom to license their program how they want, and they don't have to give me the source code if they don't want to."</blockquote></p>
          <p>Describing someone's ability to distribute only binaries without source code as "freedom" is not technically incorrect. This is only in a very trivial sense, however, and such a technical definition of "freedom" used so carelessly could justify just about anything, even murder.</p>
          <p>Licenses, however, are different. These revolve around copyright, which allows authors to restrict the distribution of their creative works. This is not freedom, but power, and using this power to do unethical things is unacceptable. Similarly, contracts which are often called "End User License Agreements" (EULAs) impose further unjust power over the users.</p>

          <p><blockquote>"But it's their program!"</blockquote></p>
          <p>They may be the developer of the program, but if you have a copy of it, it's your copy. Leonardo da Vinci may have painted the Mona Lisa, but if you have a copy of it, you have every right to draw a mustache on it, and you should have that right. In addition, the program is executed on your computer, not the developer's, and you should have the right to control what happens on your own computer.</p>

          <p><blockquote>"So you think I should be able to redistribute other people's work under my own name?"</blockquote></p>
          <p>No. It would be rather rude to claim that you wrote it when you didn't. Rules against plagiarism are fine as long as you still have the four freedoms. Many free/libre software licenses do have some sort of attribution requirement, such as requiring the copyright notice to be preserved.</p>

          <p><blockquote>"They have to make money somehow."</blockquote></p>
          <p>It is perfectly possible to make money developing free/libre software. Most software that is paid for is custom software, which is not proprietary since its only user gets the source code and the right to do what it wishes with the program. Since anyone can modify any free/libre program, free/libre software provides a free market of support; if someone, particularly a company, has a problem with a free program, they can pay a programmer, usually through a support company, to fix the problem. Crowd funding is also a distinct possibility: people interested in a new program could pay a developer up front, and since the program has been paid for by the community, it is only reasonable to give it to the community in full.</p>
          <p>Even if this weren't the case, being able to make money from an unethical practice does not make the practice any less unethical. Pirates make their money by attacking ships, but we don't give them a free pass simply because their crime gets them money.</p>

          <p><blockquote>"Even if you use exclusively free/libre software, something else is taking away some of your freedom. Your quest for total freedom is pointless."</blockquote></p>
          <p>It's true that it is nearly impossible to have perfect freedom. My laptop, for example, has a non-libre boot loader. However, you can and should keep your computing as free/libre as it possibly can be. If you admit defeat and accept losing control over your own computing, those who currently have power over you will use their power to get more power.</p>

          <p><blockquote>"There are more important things to worry about than this."</blockquote></p>
          <p>I'm not going to argue over what issues need to be taken care of most urgently. If you think some other issue is more important than proprietary software, and you want to work toward solving that problem, that's fine. Even if you don't help the free/libre software movement, it is still in your best interest to liberate your own computing. If you can't do it completely, do it as much as you are able and willing to. But whatever you do, don't give up and submit to apathy. If you are apathetic, you are more vulnerable to being controlled.</p>
