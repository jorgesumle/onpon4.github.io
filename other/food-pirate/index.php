          <p><strong>Man</strong>: "I have a confession to make. I am guilty of PIRACY."</p>
          <p>Instead of legally purchasing Nabisco's Triscuit woven wheat crackers, I baked my own.</p>
          <p>Instead of legally purchasing Nabisco's Oreo sandwitch cookies, I made my own.</p>
          <p>Instead of legally purchasing Nabisco's Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookies, I baked my own, and mine were much better than theirs!</p>
          <p>I did all of this without ever paying Nabisco a dime in royalties, and to top it all off, I gave these home-made baked goods to my friends. In total, I stole $10,000 of potential profit from Nabisco.</p>
          <p><strong>Man</strong> <em>(behind bars)</em>: "I am now rightfully in jail for my horrible actions. So remember, kids: food piracy is a CRIME. Don't do it."</p>
