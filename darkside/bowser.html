          <h1>Bowser: The Betrayal</h1>
          <p>Bowser: The Betrayal was my first game, discounting a few basic scrolling shooters. It was made with the proprietary Game Maker 6 game engine, and I never released the source code. It was scrapped a couple months after I started it due to lack of interest.</p>
          <p>Bowser: The Betrayal was a Mario fangame with Bowser as the protagonist. It was supposed to take place directly after the events of Super Mario Bros 3. The story centered around Mario turning all non-koopa soldiers against you.</p>
          <p>The game itself was not very good on its own merits; the engine was badly programmed, leading to various collision bugs, and Bowser was not able to move very fast or jump very high, making the game boring.</p>
          <p>As far as I know, no copies of this game exist anymore. The only evidence that it ever existed at all is its topic on the Game Maker Community.</p>
