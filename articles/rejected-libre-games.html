        <h3 id="clones">Games Rejected for Being Clones</h3>
        <p>The following games have been rejected because they fail to sufficiently distinguish themselves from other games. This can either be because they are clones, or because they are too generic within their genre.</p>
        <p>Because there are so many of them, games whose sole purpose for existing is to clone other games (i.e. that make no attempt whatsoever to distinguish themselves, or that even try to explicitly be as similar to the original game as possible) are not listed here.</p>

        <h3 id="alpha">Games Rejected for Incompleteness</h3>
        <p>The following games have been rejected because they don't feel like finished games.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ardentryst</li>
            <li>Hexoshi</li>
            <li>Naev</li>
            <li>SuperTux</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="misc">Games Rejected for Other Reasons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Freedroid RPG - A fun game and basically complete, but suffers from game-breaking bugs and balancing issues. Needs polishing.</li>
            <li>GHextrix - An interesting concept, but very bad production quality.</li>
            <li>Pink Pony - A very interesting variant on something like Armagetron, but unfortunately suffers from production and interface issues. In particular: it is often very hard to see the trails left behind by the ponies; there are no sound effects; and the main menu is ugly. This could all be fixed with some polishing.</li>
        </ul>
