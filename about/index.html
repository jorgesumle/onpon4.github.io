            <p>My name is Julian. I am a programmer and free/libre software advocate. My username in most places on the Internet is onpon4.</p>
            <p>I am a programmer and have been one since around 2008, though until around 2010 I was a novice and only knew Game Maker and Visual Basic (both of which I no longer use). Around 2010, I learned Python, which to this day is my favorite programming language, and I learned the TI-83 Plus's BASIC-like language as well as some C++ and Java around 2011-2012. Programming languages I currently know are Python, C, C++, and a little bit of Java. Libraries I know include Pygame, wxPython, and a small amount of SDL. I am mostly interested in game development and currently only know how to develop 2D games, but I am interested in 3D game development as well.</p>
            <p>I also know a little bit of Japanese, though I'm not very proficient (I know a few words, all hiragana, all katakana, a few kanji, and a fair amount of grammar rules; enough to speak and write in Japanese, but not enough to say anything meaningful or understand much without the help of a dictionary). My only practice in Japanese at the moment is watching Japanese cartoons, a few of which I like a lot.</p>
            <p>I am a strong advocate of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free/libre software</a>. In my personal life, I am very strict about what software I will use. My laptop has <a href="http://trisquel.info">Trisquel</a> (a completely free/libre variant of Ubuntu) installed, with absolutely no proprietary software on it. My laptop itself is a Royal Penguin from <a href="http://libre.thinkpenguin.com">Think Penguin</a>. This laptop (and, unfortunately, just about every other modern computer) does not support a free/libre BIOS, so that is the one proprietary program installed on it.</p>
            <p>I also advocate <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition">free/libre culture</a>, so I always release any significant culture works I produce under a free/libre license (usually CC BY-SA or CC0, depending on the situation). However, I don't refuse to read or view non-libre cultural works, and I also don't refuse to promote non-libre cultural works (or works that contain non-libre culture). There are two main reasons for this: first, software controls part of your life (your computing), so you cannot be free if you use proprietary software. This doesn't apply to cultural works; non-libre culture prevents you from sharing it or using it in your own cultural works, but it doesn't control you in any way. I therefore don't think free/libre culture is an urgent issue. Second, I think copyright law <a href="http://questioncopyright.org">should be abolished entirely</a>, and this would effectively make all cultural works free/libre. Still, I always prefer free/libre culture over non-libre culture, and I am more willing to directly support free/libre cultural works than non-libre cultural works.</p>
