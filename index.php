            <p>This is my personal website. You'll find all of the notable works that I've published here. Feel free to look around!</p>

            <p>Everything on here is <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free/libre software</a> and <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition">free/libre culture</a>, since I advocate both. If you find something on here that doesn't fit those two categories, let me know and I'll fix it. Of course, everything here is <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/drm-free">DRM-free</a>, too.</p>
